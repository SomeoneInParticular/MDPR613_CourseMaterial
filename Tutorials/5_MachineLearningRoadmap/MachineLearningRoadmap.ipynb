    "For 99% of analyses which use machine learningm, the method of their use can be broken down into three stages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**: Importing the data, cleaning it, and identifying the features and target\n",
    "2. **Model Creation**: Selecting which type of model to use and training it with the data available\n",
    "3. **System Evaluation**: Testing the model to confirm that it is performing well in the ways we want it to\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a template for each of these steps that you can fill in to help build up your machine learning analysis. Links to potential tools for each are also provided for your reference; most of these links have example code to work with, though you may need to scroll a bit to find it. A number of pre-built code snippets have also been created for you to copy-paste as a starting point as well, with all being available on D2L.\n",

    "Don't stress about the massive block of possible arguments that the documentation linked herein has. They are there to help programmers who want to integrate their code into a larger system, not the average user. For 99% of your use cases the usage provided by the example code (either by the documentation or ourselves) will be sufficient; we are simply providing it to provide context on these tools' full scope of applications, should you need to do more detail analyses in the future."

    "### Importing our Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of preparing the data is to import it into our program. Pandas (`import pandas as pd`) is generally advised for this, and depending on the format of the data, different commands can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `read_csv`: Imports comma-separated-value style data (usually with `.csv` or `.tsv` extensions). Often the default format for data, so if all else fails, try this. [Documentation Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html)\n",
    "* `read_excel`: Imports data created and saved using Microsoft Excel or similar. Has a large number of extensions depending on the Excel version used (`.XLS`, `.XLSX`, `.XLSM`, `.XLTX` and `.XLTM`), but pandas will usually figure out how to import it for you regardless. If your computer defaults to opening the data in excel without asking you anything, this is probably the command to use. [Documentation Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html)\n",
    "* `read_json`: Imports data stored in JavaScript-style format. These files are pretty rare outside of direct database or website queries, and are denoted with a `.json` extension. This is is most likely the format used if the prior two options fail. [Documentation Here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_json.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other formats exist as well, though they are much more uncommon. If none of the above work for you, please contact us and we will figure out the formatting and convert the data into one of the above formats for your use instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Place the code importing your data into the code block below. Place it within the `df` variable to keep consistent with subsequent blocks:"

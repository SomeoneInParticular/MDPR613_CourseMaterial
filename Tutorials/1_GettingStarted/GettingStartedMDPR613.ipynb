    "\n",
    "To load an interactive JupyterHub instance on TALC, you must be either on a University of Calgary campus's WiFi connection, or on the University of Calgary's FortiClient VPN. Instructions on how to set up the VPN on your OS are available [here](https://rcs.ucalgary.ca/Connecting_to_RCS_HPC_Systems#Connecting_to_the_University_IT_General_VPN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once on the VPN (or on Campus WiFi), open a terminal (`command prompt` on Windows, `terminal` on MacOS and Linux) and submit the following command to log into TALC remotely (replacing `your`):\n",
    "\n",
    "`ssh your.username@ucalgary.ca`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once submitted, it should request your password. Type it in and press enter. **NOTE: when typing in your password, the cursor will not move or change. This is intentional, and does not mean the password has not been entered.**\n",
    "\n",
    "It should then prompt you with a large \"terms of service\" request. Simply hit `Enter` until a prompt requesting you to accept the terms of service appears. Type `y` and hit `Enter` to accept the terms of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should then be able to log into TALC after a short delay by going to [this](talc.ucalgary.ca:8000) website and logging-in on with your University of Calgary credentials."

This will create an environment with all the packages specified within `environment.txt`. *This can take several minutes to run; be patient, and accept the install request if prompted.* If the prior fails to run, try the `conda create --name MDPR_Course --file environment.txt` command instead\n",
    " 4. Once the prior process is done, activate this new environment by submitting the `source activate MDPR_Course` command. This should change the terminal so that `(MDPR_Course)` appears to the left of your username\n",
    " 5. Install the `fairlearn` package by submitting `pip install fairlearn` into the console. This command allows for the installation of custom packages which are unavailable or do not function within `conda`\n",

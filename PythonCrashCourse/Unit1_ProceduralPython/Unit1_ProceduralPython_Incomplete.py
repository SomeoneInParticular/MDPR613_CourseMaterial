# Greet the user


# Initiate a list to track the all collected values


# Initiate a variable to track the absolute sum of said prior values


# Loop until the absolute sum exceeds 100 OR the user enter's "done"


    # Request a number from the user
    
    
    # If they type "done", break early
    
    
    # Otherwise, append the number onto our list of tracked values
    
    
    # Check if the number is negative, and make it positive if it is
        
        
    # Add the (now absolute) value to our absolute sum, declared prior
    
    
# Declare a new variable, this time for the cummulative product
    
    
# For each element in the list, do the following:


    # Add 2 to the value, and print out the result
    
    
    # Multiply the new value into the cumulative product, printing out the result
